# Tapir Member & Shift Management System

Tapir is a member and shift management system of the food cooperative [SuperCoop Berlin](https://supercoop.de).
Our Vorstand and member office uses Tapir to manage shifts and members, for example their personal data, capabilities, payments and shift statuses. It is also used for automatic mails and evaluate new applicants.
Members can use Tapir to register or unregister for shifts, search for a stand-in and see their shift status as well as upcoming shifts.

> Tapir (/ˈteɪpər/) [has a trunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgwBecM_E6Q), but not quite such a beautiful one as [Mme. l'élephan](https://github.com/elefan-grenoble/gestion-compte). Tapir is badass, [but not quite as badass as the other animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJm6nDnR2SE). Let's teach Tapir some tricks!

## Getting started

Clone the project, install docker and run

```
docker-compose up
```

This starts a container with an LDAP server and automatically loads the test data into the LDAP.

For local development and testing, set up the test database and load test data

```
# Create tables
docker-compose exec web poetry run python manage.py migrate
# Load admin (password: admin) account
docker-compose exec web poetry run python manage.py loaddata admin_account
# Load lots of test users & shifts
docker-compose exec web poetry run python manage.py populate --reset_all
```

## Troubleshooting

* On macOS, in order to set up a local Python `venv`, you might have to install Postgresql to get `psycopg2` working. Use `brew install postgresql` for that.
