# Tapir feature documentation

This is the feature documentation for Tapir.

Tapir is a member management tool targeted at cooperatives.
It helps members and organisers keep track of membership statuses.

This documentation aims to be :

- Exhaustive : it should describe everything that Tapir does.
- Readable by anyone : it is not targeted at developers
- Not specific to a particular organisation : while this is the Tapir version used by SuperCoop Berlin, this document
  intends to describe what Tapir does rather than how SuperCoop works.

When referring to a specific page, the links lead to the test instance of Tapir for SuperCoop Berlin. This instance
contains only fake information (therefore no private information) and can be edited without consequence.
