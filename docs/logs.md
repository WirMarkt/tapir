# Logs

Executing some actions create a log entry.
Log entries can be seen on the [corresponding page](https://members-test.supercoop.de/log/log_overview) or on the
member's page. The log entries page allows to filter by date, actor or "subject" (the member that the action applied to)
.
They include :

- Who did the action
- At what date and time
- Who the action applied to
- What has been done

The following actions create log entries :

- Updating the information of a member (for example changing their phone number)
- Creating more shares for a member
- Updating a share (for example setting the end date)
- An email got sent
- A member has registered (or got registered) to a shift slot (or an ABCD shift)
- The attendance status of a member to a shift slot got updated (for example, marked as attended)
- A member got unregistered from an ABCD shift
- A stand-in has been found for a shift slot
- The shift information of a member got updated (for example, they have a new capability)
- A payment got registered
- A shift exemption got created
- A shift exemption got edited

It is also possible to create entries with arbitrary text from the member's page.
