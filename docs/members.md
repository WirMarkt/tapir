# Members

Tapir keeps track of past, present and future members.
The [list of members](https://members-test.supercoop.de/coop/member/) can be accessed with the "Members" link of the
sidebar.

## A member

The following information are stored for each member.

- Their unique member number
- First name
- Last name
- Email-Address
- Phone number
- Date of birth
- Address (street, house number, postcode, city, country)
- Language (EN or DE)
- Whether they attended a welcome session or not

Normal members can see information about themselves.
Members with member-office access can see and edit the information of all members.

Editing the information about a member creates a log entry.

## Creating a member

The first step to create a member is to create an Applicant. This can be done with the create button on the top right of
the [Applicant list page](https://members-test.supercoop.de/coop/user/draft/).

### Applicants

Applicants can be created with partial information. They are intended to store whatever information is available about a
person that expressed interest in joining the organization.

All the information stored about members can also be saved on applicants. All the fields can be edited from the
applicant's page.
On top of those are also saved :

- Whether the person has signed a membership agreement yet
- How many shares they would like to buy.

The membership agreement can be downloaded as PDF from the applicant's page, prefilled with the available information.

It is possible to delete on applicant from the applicant's page.

### From Applicant to member

A member can be created from an applicant from the applicant's page if the following conditions are met :

- The applicant has a first name, last name, email-address
- The membership agreement has been signed
- The applicant intends to buy at least one share.

Creating a member from an applicant :

- Deletes the applicant
- Creates the member
- Creates the desired number of shares for that member, with the current day's date as starting validity for the shares
- Sends a membership confirmation email to the new member, with a membership confirmation PDF attached. Active members
  and investing members receive a different email.

Creating a member on Tapir does not automatically create a Tapir account for them. See the member account documentation.

## Member status

Tapir recognized three statuses for members :

- Active : for most members
- Investing : for members who don't take part in the organisation's activity. This can restrict what they
  are able to do within the organisation. For example at SuperCoop Berlin, they don't do any shift, but are not allowed
  to vote or shop.
- Sold : for people who had shares but sold them (either to other members or back to the organisation). They are not
  members of the organisation anymore.
