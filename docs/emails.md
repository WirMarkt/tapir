# Emails

Most emails that Tapir sends are visible on the [email page](https://members-test.supercoop.de/core/email_list). The
email page shows a description, a preview of the subject and body, and a link to download a copy of the last sent
version of that email.

Emails are either translated in the member's preferred language or contain both english and german text.

Sending one of those email always creates a log entry for the corresponding member. The log entry has a download link to
the .eml file that is an exact copy of the email that the member received.

Tapir sends the following emails, always to the corresponding member :

- They missed a shift
- They will have a shift in 7 days
- Someone took over a shift that they were looking for a stand-in for
- Confirmation that they got more shares
- Confirmation of membership for active members
- Confirmation of membership for investing members
- Tapir account created

The following emails are exceptions : they are not visible on the email page and don't create a log entry :

- Password reset
- Accounting recap
