# Welcome desk

The goal of the welcome desk is to allow normal members (without member office access) who are currently doing a shift
to search for a member and check if they (trying to access the shop) are allowed to shop, without giving away private
information.

Members with member office rights always have access to the welcome desk page.
Normal members have access to the welcome desk during their shifts (from 20 minutes before the start to 20 minutes after
it ends).

A member is considered allowed to shop if :

- They have a Tapir account
- Their shift account balance is -1 or higher
- Their member status is active (not investing or sold)

If the member is not allowed to shop, the welcome desk will list the reasons why.

The welcome desk can also display the following warnings. A warning does not prevent a user from shopping (the welcome
desk shows "can shop" and the warning).

- The member should register to a shift (shown if the member is in the ABCD shift system and they are not registered to
  an ABCD shift)
- They have not attended a welcome session yet

## Co-Purchaser

To each member can be associated a "co-purchaser". That other person can use the shop without being a member. If a
member has a co-purchaser, the welcome desk will show it.
